This was coded using Xcode 8 and Swift 3.
The project was only tested using it, so I'm unsure about older versions working with it.
To build it, just import it into xcode 8 to and build it normally. The layout is ran using the iPhone 6s simulator, the layout isn't
responsive at the moment. 
My approach towards the application is using basic operations and switch statements to complete the calculator functionality.
The use of variables was to hold any data that is needed for the calculator to function. I used an array to hold the button inputs,
and manipulated it depending on which part of the equation that the calculator was currently on.


Screenshot 1 is the starting screen.

Screenshot 2 is just entering an "8"

Screenshot 3 is entering "+8=" completing "8+8=", shows 16 on the screen.
